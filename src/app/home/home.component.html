            up and configuring yet another token.

          Cloud complexity is at full throttle. What started as a promising way
          for developers to rapidly build scalable web services has turned into
          the anti pattern for the next generation. We need a faster, simpler
          and more affordable way to leverage services in the Cloud.

        <br />

          Micro (aka M3O) was built with this in mind. To help developers 10x
          without dealing with the likes of AWS. If you're interested to learn

    <div class="about">
      <div class="col">
        <p>
          In 2013 a few of us met at a ride hailing startup in London called
          Hailo. Back then we were competing against Uber and pushed hard to
          scale our technology to compete. It's there we cut our teeth on AWS
          and the cloud complexity we all had to endure just to ship a mobile
          app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>
          In 2015, Micro started life as a distributed systems development
          framework and became a popular open source project that still lives on
          today. That however only solved one half of the problem. It's not just
          the development of cloud services that's difficult, it's also how you
          consume them.

          M3O is a new cloud platform. One that focuses entirely on the
          developer experience. We do away with endless marketing spiel,
          thousands of services and a sea of docs. Our hope, by just giving you
          some useful APIs and examples, you'll be able to move 10x faster than
          before.
