# M3O

[M3O](https://m3o.com) is an open source public cloud platform. We are building a new AWS alternative for the next generation of developers.

## Overview

AWS has becoming the monstrous behemoth public cloud provider we all love to hate. It's massive complexity and confusing pricing has made it an incredibly 
difficult choice for developers to adopt. But what's the alternative? M3O is a new open source public cloud platform for the next generation of developers. Consume public APIs as simpler programmable building blocks for lightning fast development of products and services.

M3O is powered by the open source [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) project and programmable real world [Micro Services](https://github.com/micro/services).

## Features

- **üî• Dev UX** - The developer experience is first priority. A slick new UX for the next generation of developers.
- **‚òùÔ∏è One Token** - Use one Micro API token to fulfill all your API needs. Access multiple APIs with a single token.
- **‚ö° Fast Access** - Using a new API is easy - no need to learn yet another API, it's all the same Micro developer experience.
- **üÜì Free to start** - It's a simple pay as you go model and everything is priced per request. Top up your account and start making calls.
- **üö´ Anti AWS Billing** - Don't get lost in a sea of infinite cloud billing. We show you exactly what you use and don't hide any of the costs.

## Getting Started

## How it Works

M3O is built on existing public cloud infrastructure with managed kubernetes along with our own [infrastructure automation](https://github.com/m3o/platform) 
and abstraction layer. We host the open source [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) project as the base Cloud OS and use it to 
power all the [Services](https://github.com/micro/services), which are also open source.

We then have our own custom dev UX on top and [backend](https://github.com/m3o/backend) for management.

## Development

This project is venture funded with a combination of open source services, managed hosting and a team with much distain for AWS.

## How to run

The source in this project provides an open UX for anyone to run locally or host themselves. The backend is hosted at [api.m3o.com](https://api.m3o.com).

```
npm install && ng serve
```

Or with server side rendering:

```
npm run dev:ssr
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## How to regenerate the sitemap?

Go to any sitemap generator (example: https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) site and commit the output to src/sitemap.xml
